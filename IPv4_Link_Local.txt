IPv4 Link-Local

This document describes a method by which a host may automatically
   configure an interface with an IPv4 address in the 169.254/16 prefix
   that is valid for Link-Local communication on that interface.  This
   is especially valuable in environments where no other configuration
   mechanism is available.  The IPv4 prefix 169.254/16 is registered
   with the IANA for this purpose.  Allocation of IPv6 Link-Local
   addresses is described in "IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"
   [RFC2462].
